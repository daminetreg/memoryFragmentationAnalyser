Memory Fragmentation Analyser
-----------------------------

    The Memory Fragmentation Analyser is a tool thought to analyse memory fragmentation by computing which block were allocated or freed during the application execution, this calculations are used to represent a fragmentation image of the different memory block in real time.

WORK IN PROGRESS
----------------
    Please note that this project is a work in progress and in the current state won't bring you anything at all, it contains only the parser/writer for the storage format used to store allocation/deallocations.

    To get an idea about the project take a look at the doc/, but don't expect to be able to update it.

TODO
----
    - Add MemoryOperation storage and adds it as parameter to the parse operations.
    - Add malloc/realloc/free/sbrk/brk hooks to count allocations/deallocations
    - In future versions this tool will provide a feature to show which calling module is responsible of the allocation and deallocation of the components. Basing the analysis on a patched valgrind massif tool.

Compile
-------
    To compile the memory fragmentation analyser simply execute the following commands.

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make -j3
